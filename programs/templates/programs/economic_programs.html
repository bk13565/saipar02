                            This project studies the global consequences of financialization by tracking copper through its value chain – from the mining pits in Zambia to trading firms in Switzerland and ultimately to its final destination in China.  The goal of the study is to come to a better understanding of Switzerland’s role in the global economy and the consequences of commodity trade on local lifehoods  in Zambia and China. The study will be conducted by a multidisciplinary team led by Rita Kesselring of the University of Basel, and will combine anthropological, economic, legal, and geographical analyses on financialization and global production networks. In Zambia, the leader of the research team is Marja Hinfelaar, who works with Tinenenji Banda, Wilma Nchito, Edna Kabala-Litana, John Lungu, Manenga Ndulo, Maio Bulwayo and Dale Mudenda.

                        <p>
                            What are the effects of the financialisation of the commodity trading on local lives and what are the policy recommendations to be drawn for Swiss and international regulatory actors? Over the last 15 years, Switzerland has emerged as a major global commodity-trading hub. Swiss traders take an intermediary position in commodity chains; they connect markets, influence the pricing process and, unintentionally, change the life-worlds of people around the world. The increased financialisation of commodity trading change the way value is ascribed to commodities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project will study the way decisions taken in Switzerland interact with these local life-worlds. It will analyse consequences of the financialisation of commodities trade by following one single commodity – copper – from mining pits and the surrounding communities in Zambia through towns and harbours on African transport corridors, through Swiss trading firms and banks to the sites of industrial production and recycling in China. The heuristic focus on one specific commodity will enable a study of reconfigurations in commodity chains, of their global consequences and of Switzerland’s role as one of the most important platforms of commodity trade worldwide.

                        <p>
                            The interdisciplinary project brings together experts on particular sites of copper’s journey with specialists on commodity chains. In cooperation between researchers based in international universities, Swiss and Southern NGOs and the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD), the project will explore the characteristics of transnational links and their consequences for social dynamics in particular sites. SAIPAR has taken on three research projects on dealing with mineral value chain and copper trade statistics, functioning of regulatory bodies on the Copperbelt and financialization of customary land in mining areas.

                            The findings will contribute to a better understanding of global connections and will have direct results for policy interventions relating to transparency in the Swiss commodity sector, transnational policy coherence and sustainable development in the Global South. The research results will feed into policy recommendation for Swiss and international regulatory actors.

                            The Borrowing Charter aims to provide a basis for improvements in the transparency in the contraction and management of public debt, the issuance of public guarantees, the selection and implementation of debt financed projects and the formulation and execution of overall fiscal policy, within the context of strengthened legal frameworks to secure long term inclusive development. SAIPAR assisted Afrodad in improving the most recent charter (fiscal and legal aspects). The revised borrowing charter was validated at a workshop  Lusaka 26 April 2018.

                        <h6><i>Development Policy in Practice: Lessons from South Korea Development Experience</i></h6>
                        <p>
                            The Development Research Department (EDRE) of the African Development Bank (AfDB) is undertaking research on “The African Economy: Development Policy in Practice,” using a team of African researchers, and in collaboration with experts from Korean Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP). The research explores the interplay of institutions and economic development in Africa. In particular, it will examine the role of the state in economic development and the dynamics of fostering institutions for structural transformation. Lessons will be drawn from the development experience of South Korea. It is expected that the collaboration will advance the partnership and knowledge exchange between the AfDB and Korean Ihstitute for International Economic Policy (KIEP) as well as enrich cross­ fertilization of country experiences between RMCs and Korea.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The focus of the research is on the transformative role of the state in the economic development process. Under what political economy conditions do states become effective within and across different domains of development (including economic growth, equity, structural transformation, employment, poverty reduction and basic service delivery)? It involves a detailed examination of institutions, processes, mechanisms and practices in four African countries (Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia) against the background of Korea’s development experience. Institutional performance issues to be evaluated include regulatory and government effectiveness, rule of law, political stability, transparency, accountability and control of corruption. Questions to be interrogated will include whether and how systems actually work in delivering services or products; and how the interplay of the interests of various constituencies (such as households, communities, businesses and government entities) and across levels of government (such as local, provincial and national) affects the effectiveness of service delivery responsibilities.
